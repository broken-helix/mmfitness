            -Personal Trainer.

            This service is for clients based in Colchester only (in-person).

            -1:1 Online Coaching.

            This service provides dedicated 1 to 1 personalised training for those unable to attend in-person training, or those with time constraints.

            What is online 1:1 online coaching?

            This is a fully personalised training program which is carefully tailored to your needs and goals. You will receive full support from your coach.

            What is included?

            · Full support from your coach – permanent communication with your coach and feedback

            · Exercise Form Analysis – you sending videos to your coach who will then assess your form.

            · Access to the training app – Here, you will have access to your training program, in depth form videos for every exercise you will need, your meal plan (if applicable), some lifestyle tips, and lots of educational content.

            · Weekly check-in – Your coach will review your progress with you every week to make sure you are on the right course. Here we will

            discuss how your training and diet are progressing, and will check if body composition is changing to plan. The latter will be assessed via photos in conjunction with other data gathered during the week.

            My programs

            In fitness there is no “one-fits-all” approach. Every person and every body in unique and that’s how I like to treat them (you are unique and so are my programmes). (james, this bit of text in read could be place in any other part of the website, it is just an idea to reinforce the idea of muy programme being more unique).

            My programs are tailored to your needs. They are designed to take in to account your lifestyle, your availability, your equipment, your age, your fitness level, your diet, past injuries, your hobbies and your occupation. They adjust as you progress based on your progress.

            I offer both, gym and home based workouts but can also provide a combination of both.

            Programs are based on monthly subscription.
